                                                               Medium access control sublayer

Networks can be divided into two categories :
1)Using point to point connections   
2)Using broadcast channels(multiaccess channel & random access  channel)

>>>> The medium access conbtrol is a part of data link layer and protocol involved in this sublayer are responsible for the data communication b/w several users
who share the common channel. 

The channel allocation problem :

>>>>Assumption to take during dynamic channel allocation :
i)Independent Traffic − It is assumed that the users are independent of each other, i.e. each user has to send or receive data which is 
independent of the data transmission of the other users in the network system.

ii)Single Channel − The algorithms assume that all contending stations request for transmission via a single channel. 

iii)Detectable Collisions − If two frames from different stations are simultaneously transmitted, 
the resulting signal is distorted, and a collision is said to occur. If a collision occurs, all stations should be able to detect the collision. 
The frames lost due to collisions are retransmitted.

iv)Continuous Time or Slotted Time − Depending upon the allocation scheme, time may be considered as continuous or slotted. In continuous time,
 frame transmission can start at any instant. In slotted time, time is divided into discrete slots. If a slot does not contain any frame, 
it is called an idle slot; if it contains a single frame, then the transmission is successful;
if it contains more than one frames, then a collision is said to occur.

v)Carrier Sense or No Carrier Sense − The stations may or may not be capable of detecting whether the channel is in use before sending the frames. 
In algorithms which are based upon carrier sense, a station sends frame only when it senses that the channel is not busy.
On the other hand,in algorithms based upon no carrier sense, the stations transmit a frame when it is available and later are informed whether 
successful transmission had occurred or not.

1) Dynamic channel allocation in LANs and MANs :

2)Multiple access protocol :
  >> ALOHA : i) pure 
            ii) slotted 
>> Frame time : Frame time is the time that passes between each of those frames. 
>> i)Pure ALOHA :
    In pure ALOHA, the time of transmission is continuous. Whenever a station has an available frame, 
    it sends the frame. If there is collision and the frame is destroyed, the sender waits for a random amount of time before retransmitting it.

    Throughput in pure alpha: S=G.P(0),S=G.e^(-2G)
    S=throughput,G=mean value of frames transmitted per frame time,
    P(0)=The probability that a frame doesnot suffer(probability of success)
    ---If G=0.5 it will be maximum throughput.
    ---Max channel utilization 18%

>> ii)Slotted ALOHA(S=G.P(0),S=G.e^(-G)) :
      Slots are discrete time periods that are used to divide up the shared channel. Only at the start of each time slot 
      is the station able to transmit data. If multiple stations attempt to transmit at the start of the same time slot, there may still be collisions.
     --- If G=1 it will be maximum throughput.
     --- Max channel utilization 37%
